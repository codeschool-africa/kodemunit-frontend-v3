              Kodemunit is a learning platform built on the foundation of
              community, sharing and helping one another to become better and
              technology ready citizens of the world. It was started in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
              This platform was created to help us provide mentorship to
              beginners we will be able to reduce the time that someone can
              spend online trying to figure out what to learn, instead for
              someone to go across the internet with a lot of questions on what
              to learn and how now through our career guidance and mentorship
              program someone can connect with mentors who have already been
              through process and figure out what to do.
